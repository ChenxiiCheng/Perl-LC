## Solving leetcode questions with Perl

> I started to learn and use Perl in the past half-year. I feel the best way to learn a new programming language is to practice it with real coding problems. So I created this repo and use it to document my Perl approach for leetcode questions.

- Perl version: 5.18 (Mac built-in version)
